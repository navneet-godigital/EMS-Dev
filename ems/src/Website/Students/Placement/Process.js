As soon as the student is enrolled, he will get the id password on his mobile, whose login will be done only on emaxindia.in and the verification of the roll number will be done only on the website of emaxindia.in. After that the study will be done in the institute (we have some such courses which can be done online and at home, their process is different) As soon as the student's study is completed, then after that the student's exam will be taken.</h3>
